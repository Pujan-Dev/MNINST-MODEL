## ⚙️ How to Host a FastAPI App in Railway

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

* GitHub account
* Railway account ([https://railway.app](https://railway.app))
* FastAPI project pushed to GitHub

### 📁 Required Files for FastAPI

Make sure your FastAPI project includes:

```
📁 my-fastapi-app
├── app.py               # Your FastAPI main app file
├── requirements.txt     # List of Python dependencies
├── Procfile             # (Optional) Tells Railway how to run the app
└── .env.example         # (Optional) Template for environment variables
```

**`app.py`** (example):

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello from Railway!"}
```

**`requirements.txt`**:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
```

**`Procfile`** (if needed):

```
web: uvicorn app:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=${PORT}
```

### 🚀 Steps to Deploy on Railway

1. Go to [https://railway.app](https://railway.app) and log in.
2. Click **"New Project"** → **"Deploy from GitHub Repo"**.
3. Choose your FastAPI project repo.
4. Railway auto-detects the environment and installs dependencies.
5. If not detected, manually set up:

   * **Start command**:
     `uvicorn app:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=${PORT}`
   * **Python version** via environment variables if needed.
6. Wait for deployment → Get your public URL!
